### Long Description (3500 characters max)
**FinSage: Your AI Trading Co-Pilot**

FinSage is an autonomous, data-driven trading and portfolio monitoring agent designed to help retail investors make better financial decisions while protecting their capital.

- **Real-Time Market Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of market data, news, and fundamental metrics
- **Auditable Decision Making**: Every suggestion includes source references and clear rationale
- **Multiple Operating Modes**: MONITOR (alerts only), SUGGEST (recommendations), EXECUTE (trading with permission), BACKTEST (historical analysis)
- **Comprehensive Signal Library**: Technical indicators, fundamental analysis, news sentiment, and risk flags

**Sponsor Tool Integration:**
- **Airia**: Agent orchestration, workflow management, and policy enforcement
- **Apify**: Real-time data scraping from Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and news sources
- **TrueFoundry**: AI Gateway for model hosting with governance and observability
- **Sentry**: Comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring

**Safety Features:**
- No automatic trading unless explicitly enabled in EXECUTE mode
- Strict risk limits and position sizing controls
